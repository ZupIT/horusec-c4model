Horusec is an open source tool that performs static code analysis to identify security flaws during the development process. Currently, the languages for analysis are: C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Golang, Terraform, Javascript, Typescript, Kubernetes, PHP, C, HTML, JSON, Dart, Elixir, Shell, Nginx, Swift. The tool has options to search for key leaks and security flaws in all files of your project, as well as in Git history.
