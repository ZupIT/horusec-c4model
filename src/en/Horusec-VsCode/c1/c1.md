## Description
A system context diagram is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to refer and see the great figure.Design a diagram showing your system as a box in the center, surrounded by your users and otherssystems that interacts.

Detail is not important here, as this is your expanded opinion showing a large image of the landscape of the system. The focus must be in people (actors, papers, personas, etc.) and software systems, rather than technologies, protocols andOther low level details. It is the type of diagram that you could show for non-technical people.
