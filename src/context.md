# What is Horusec?
Horusec is an open source tool that performs static code analysis to identify security flaws during the development process. Currently, the languages for analysis are: C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Golang, Terraform, Javascript, Typescript, Kubernetes, PHP, C, HTML, JSON, Dart, Elixir, Shell, Nginx, Swift. The tool has options to search for key leaks and security flaws in all files of your project, as well as in Git history. Horusec can be used by the developer through the CLI and by the DevSecOps team on CI /CD mats.

### Manage the vulnerabilities found
In addition to identifying and centralizing information, Horusec provides a tool for managing access and viewing vulnerabilities.

### Add to your pipeline and have more safety
Another goal is to ensure that your project's new functionality is safe. For this we add a new step.
